REGEX:(inspired from PERL programming language)
kind of a pattern,  RegEx AKA Pattern Matching.
regEx helps in matching a pattern against a String.
  1. ^char = Starts with
  2. char$ = ends with
  3. \\b 'char or word' \\b = word boundary in a sentence
  4. \\b [aeiou]= word begins with a vowel
  5.  \\b t= word in a sentence begins with t
  6. \\b time \\b= sentence has word 'time'
  ---> Quantifiers
  7. ? = zero or 1
  8. * = zero or more
  9. + = one or more
  10. / =
  11. //. -> matches for ., takes as normal character OR Pattern.Literal flag
  12. [^c]= excluding the char 'c'


--------- ZERO LENGTH MATCH ()--- matching with the empty string, can occur in many cases
 like beginning/ end of an input String
  1. Quantifier matches with an empty String
